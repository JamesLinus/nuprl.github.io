           @p{This paper presents a new approach to isolation and uniqueness in an existing, widely-used language, Scala. The approach is unique in the way it addresses some of the most important obstacles to the adoption of type system extensions for aliasing control. First, adaptation of existing code requires only a minimal set of annotations. Only a single bit of information is required per class. Surprisingly, the paper shows that this information can be provided by the object-capability discipline, widely-used in program security. We formalize our approach as a type system and prove key soundness theorems. The type system is implemented for the full Scala language, providing, for the first time, a sound integration with Scala’s local type inference. Finally, we empirically evaluate the conformity of existing Scala open-source code on a corpus of over 75,000 LOC.}}

We shall start with *demos* first, explaining short code examples in

new language 'Eff' of Matija Pretnar and Andrej Bauer, that first
implemented so-called effect handlers, and finally the language
'Frank' of Conor McBride, that integrates these handlers in a more
uniform style of "effectful call-by-value programming".

Only second will we discuss some *theory*, in an accessible way:
monads and algebraic effects, which are two distinct ways to formalize
side-effects, and the difference between "direct" and "indirect" style
of effectful programming.

Underlying this talk are two larger, important questions of
programming language design, that will be touched during the talk and
we can discuss further afterwards:
- Do programming language need a facility for user-defined side-effects?
- When should we encode new design ideas as libraries/macros in an
  expressive language, and when should we design languages afresh for
  them?}

Because of this application-centric approach, software development plays a key role to realize the full potential of IoT.

In this talk, we argue that there is a continuum between orchestrating connected objects in the small and in the large, fostering a unified approach to application development. We examine the requirements for orchestrating connected objects and address them with domain-specific design concepts. We then show how to map these design concepts into dedicated programming patterns and runtime mechanisms.

Our work revolves around domain-specific notations integrated into a tool-based design methodology, dedicated to develop IoT applications.

The relation is powerful enough to reason about typical capability patterns and supports evolvable invariants on shared data structures, capabilities with restricted authority over them and isolated components with restricted communication channels. We use a novel notion of effect parametricity for deriving properties about effects.

            Performance clearly matters to users. The most common software update
            on the AppStore *by far* is "Bug fixes and performance enhancements."
            Now that Moore's Law Free Lunch has ended, programmers have to work
            hard to get high performance for their applications. But why is
            performance so hard to deliver?}
        @p{ I will first explain why our current approaches to evaluating and
            optimizing performance don't work, especially on modern hardware and
            for modern applications. I will then present two systems that address
            these challenges. Stabilizer is a tool that enables statistically
            sound performance evaluation, making it possible to understand the
            impact of optimizations and conclude things like the fact that the -O2
            and -O3 optimization levels are indistinguishable from noise
            (unfortunately true).}
        @p{ Since compiler optimizations have largely run out of steam, we need
            better profiling support, especially for modern concurrent,
            multi-threaded applications. Coz is a novel "causal profiler" that
            lets programmers optimize for throughput or latency, and which
            pinpoints and accurately predicts the impact of optimizations. Coz's
            approach unlocks numerous previously unknown optimization
            opportunities. Guided by Coz, we improved the performance of Memcached
            by 9%, SQLite by 25%, and accelerated six Parsec applications by as
            much as 68%; in most cases, these optimizations involved modifying
            under 10 lines of code.}

            2013 (Stabilizer) and SOSP 2015 (Coz), where it received a Best Paper

            @p{Computer networks do not simply connect machines together, but run several
                        applications on network devices, such as load balancers, intrusion detection
                        systems, authentication portals, and more. Historically, these applications were
                        black-boxes running on proprietary hardware, but software-defined networking
                        (SDN) now allows anyone to write their own programs using open networking
                        protocols (e.g., OpenFlow). So, what are the right abstractions for programming networks? This talk will try
                        to address this question in three ways.}
                        @p{First, we present a syntactic theory of network forwarding called NetKAT, which supports equational reasoning about network-wide behavior. Using NetKAT, programmers can ask and answer questions like, "Can A communicate with B?",
                        "Does all traffic traverse my intrusion detection system?", "Is there a loop in
my network?", and so on.}
@p{Second, we present a fast and efficient compiler for NetKAT. Although several
network compilers already exist, they are unusable on even moderately sized
networks. Using new data structures and compilation algorithms, our new compiler
is two orders of magnitudes faster than prior work and scales to large
datacenter networks.}
@p{Finally, we consider the problem of building a reliable runtime system for
NetKAT. NetKAT abstracts away several low-level details of networking hardware.
Although this is a boon for the network programmer, the burden now shifts to us
to engineer abstractions correctly. We present a Coq-certified runtime system
that is proven correct with respect to a detailed operational model software-
defined networks.

Scalloc is a typical example of a very complex, multi-year research effort while selfie is, at least for now, a purely educational, many-year effort in teaching compiler, operating system, and virtual machine design based on a single, highly principled software platform. So far scalloc and selfie only share the passion of their authors and are otherwise two distinct projects. Yet earlier versions of selfie, before they were even identified as such, were instrumental in bringing up the generation of students who did scalloc.
        The main ideas behind scalloc are: uniform treatment of small and big objects through so-called virtual spans, efficiently and effectively reclaiming free memory through fast and scalable global data structures, and constant-time (modulo synchronization) allocation and deallocation operations that trade off memory reuse and spatial locality without being subject to false sharing. The main ideas behind selfie are: a compiler written in and for a tiny subset of C called C* which uses the dereferencing * operator of C for memory access but lacks data structures and many other features and a MIPS emulator written in C* that can execute itself. Both are combined and extended by students to do very cool stuff.

  Memory corruption plagues systems since the dawn of computing. With the
rise of defense techniques like stack cookies, ASLR, and DEP, attacks
have become much more complicated, yet control-flow hijack attacks are
still prevalent. Attacks leverage code reuse attacks, often using some
form of information disclosure. Stronger defense mechanisms have been
proposed but none have seen wide deployment so far (i) due to the time
it takes to deploy a security mechanism, (ii) incompatibility with
specific features, and (iii) most severely due to performance overhead.
In the talk, we evaluate the security benefits and limitations of the
status quo and look into upcoming defense mechanisms (and their attacks).

Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) and Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) are two of
the hottest upcoming defense mechanisms. CFI guarantees that the runtime
control flow follows the statically determined control-flow graph. An
attacker may reuse any of the valid transitions at any control flow
transfer. CPI on the other hand is a dynamic property that enforces
memory safety guarantees like bounds checks for code pointers by
separating code pointers from regular data. We will discuss differences
and advantages/disadvantages of both approaches, especially the security
benefits they give under novel attacks like Counterfeit Object-Oriented
Programming (COOP) and Control-Flow Bending (CFB).  COOP reuses complete
functions as gadgets and CFB bends the control flow along valid but
unintended paths in the control-flow graph of a program.

              R is a dynamic language for statistical
        computing and graphics. In recent years R has become a major framework
        for both statistical practice and research. This talk present a very
        brief outline of the R language and its evolution and describe some
        current efforts on improvements to the core computational engine,
        including work on compilation of R code, efforts to take advantage of
        multiple processor cores, and modifications to support working with
        larger data sets.

              Modern verification techniques are becoming
        ever-more powerful and sophisticated, and building tools to implement
        them is a time-consuming and difficult task. Writing a new verifier to
        validate each on-paper approach is impractical; for this reason
        intermediate verification languages such as Boogie and Why3 have become
        popular over the last decade. However, verification approaches geared
        around complex program logics (such as separation logic) have typically
        been implemented in specialised tools, since the reasoning is hard to
        map down to first-order automated reasoning. In practice, this means
        that a rich variety of modern techniques have no corresponding tool
        support.  In this talk, I will present the new Silver intermediate
        verification language, which has been designed to facilitate the
        lightweight implementation of a variety of modern methodologies for
        program verification. In contrast to lower-level verification languages,
        Silver provides native support for heap reasoning; modes of reasoning
        such as concurrent separation logic, dynamic frames and
        rely-guarantee/invariants can be simply encoded.  Silver has been
        developed as part of the Viper project, which provides two automated
        back-end verifiers for Silver programs. Since releasing our software in
        September last year, it has been used for (internal and external)
        projects to build tools for Java verification, non-blocking concurrency
        reasoning, flow-sensitive typing and reasoning about GPU and Linux
        kernel code.

              In this talk, I will first present a method and
        a tool TARA for generating succinct representations of sets of
        concurrent traces. In our work, we focus on trace sets that contain all
        correct or all incorrect permutations of events from a given trace. We
        represent such trace sets as Boolean combinations of happens-before
        ordering constraints between events.  Our trace set representations can
        drive diverse verification, fault localization, repair, and synthesis
        techniques for concurrent programs. In the remainder of the talk, I will
        focus on the use of our representation for synchronization synthesis.
        This work appears in POPL 2015 and CAV 2015, and is joint work with
        Pavol Cerny, Ed Clarke, Ashutosh Gupta, Tom Henzinger, Arjun
        Radhakrishna, Leonid Ryzhyk and Thorsten Tarrach.

              @br{}
              @p{The PL Seminar, Jr. is a seminar where students new to the area can discuss the study of programming languages. This seminar is not intended to replace the main PL Seminar, but we hope that it can augment that by providing a place where junior students can discuss topics and ask questions at a pace better suited to our level of knowledge. Topics include:
                @ul{
                  @li{Design and analysis of programming languages: syntax, semantics, pragmatics (ie, how do you use a language feature in real programs?)}
                  @li{Implementation of programming languages}
                  @li{Program development, both large and small}
                  @li{Programming pedagogy}
                  @li{Programming tools and environments}
                  @li{and anything else that catches our interest.}
                }
                Topics are not limited to current research, but include older papers, textbook chapters, and surveys.

              @small{
                @p{In many ways, the existing PL Seminar doesn't serve junior students well. For us, it is intended to provide an environment where we can go to listen to current research. While nobody expects us to understand the entire presentation, we would ideally be able to say, "I didn't understand that, but it sounded really neat." By and large, that hasn't happened, for a number of reasons:
                  @ul{
                    @li{For many of us, once our level of comprehension drops below a certain threshold, we tend to get frustrated and tune out. It's very difficult to say that something sounds interesting when you don't even feel like you understand the language.}
                    @li{The discussion environment isn't really helpful to junior students. The questions from the audience are typically research-oriented; often, a great deal of background knowledge is required to follow the ensuing discussions.}
                    @li{To overuse a metaphor, the bandwidth available for discussion tends to be filled by a relatively small number of people; it's often difficult for a junior student to get a word in edgewise.}

              @h4{Seminar Culture}

              @small{@p{For this seminar to be as useful as possible, it is important we establish the right "seminar culture." This is, of course, something that is hard to describe, and it will shift and evolve. However, there are some guidelines for what we are trying to accomplish:
                @ul{
                  @li{Attendees are willing to learn and to help others learn. They should not come in order to demonstrate how much smarter they are than everyone else just because they know so much more about a specific topic.}
                  @li{Active listening is encouraged. Ask questions! In particular, while research questions are of course welcome, basic comprehension questions are especially encouraged. If you don't understand something, or if you don't believe a step in a proof, ask!}
                  @li{An important corollary: no question is too stupid to ask. This places an obligation on other members of the seminar: rather than express frustration at the basic nature of a question, look at it as an opportunity to practice your skills in explaining things.}
                  @li{Of course, while active listening is a good thing, we want to avoid having a few people fill the communications channel. So, please be considerate of the other people present and allow them to join the discussions as well.}
                }
                @p{Any attendee may propose a topic; we'll solicit volunteers to present a survey of the area. We expect that most of the presenters will be junior PL students, although outside presentations are welcome.}}}
